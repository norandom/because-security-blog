# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post written using our new **markdown-based blog system** with FastAPI backend.

## Features

The blog system supports:

- **Markdown** formatting with frontmatter
- **Tags** for categorization
- **Search** functionality
- **Attachments** and assets
- **Statistics** and analytics

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python code snippet:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from my blog!")
    return "Welcome!"
```

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll be covering:

1. Security best practices
2. Python performance optimization
3. Building with Nuitka
4. Container security with distroless images

Stay tuned for more content!
