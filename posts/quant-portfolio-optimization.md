# Modern Portfolio Theory with Machine Learning

Traditional Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) provides a solid foundation for portfolio construction, but machine learning techniques can significantly enhance risk-adjusted returns through dynamic optimization.

## Enhanced Risk Models

### Traditional vs ML-Enhanced Approaches

**Traditional MPT**:
- Static covariance matrices
- Historical return assumptions
- Linear optimization constraints

**ML-Enhanced MPT**:
- Dynamic risk factor modeling
- Regime-aware return forecasting
- Non-linear constraint optimization

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Factor Model Construction

```python
# Dynamic factor model with regime detection
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import numpy as np

def regime_aware_factor_model(returns, n_regimes=3):
    """
    Build regime-aware factor model for portfolio optimization
    """
    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=n_regimes)
    regimes = gmm.fit_predict(returns)
    
    # Factor loadings per regime
    factor_models = {}
    for regime in range(n_regimes):
        regime_data = returns[regimes == regime]
        factor_models[regime] = fit_factor_model(regime_data)
    
    return factor_models
```

### 2. Dynamic Allocation Strategy

Key components for ML-enhanced allocation:

- **Regime Detection**: Hidden Markov Models for market state identification
- **Return Forecasting**: LSTM networks for time-series prediction
- **Risk Estimation**: GARCH models with neural network enhancements
- **Transaction Cost Modeling**: Reinforcement learning for execution optimization

## Performance Metrics

Enhanced Sharpe ratios through:
- Dynamic rebalancing (15-20% improvement)
- Regime-aware allocation (10-15% improvement)
- Transaction cost optimization (3-5% improvement)

## Risk Management Integration

```python
# VaR calculation with ML models
def ml_enhanced_var(portfolio, confidence_level=0.05):
    """
    Calculate Value at Risk using ML-predicted distributions
    """
    predicted_returns = lstm_model.predict(market_features)
    simulated_portfolio_returns = monte_carlo_simulation(
        portfolio, predicted_returns, n_simulations=10000
    )
    return np.percentile(simulated_portfolio_returns, confidence_level * 100)
```

The integration of machine learning with traditional portfolio theory opens new avenues for risk-adjusted alpha generation while maintaining rigorous mathematical foundations.
